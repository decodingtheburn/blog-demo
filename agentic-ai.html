                    <p>Artificial Intelligence is evolving from simple chatbots to fully autonomous agents capable of
                        executing complex tasks. This shift is what we call "Agentic AI".</p>

                    <h2>What is Agentic AI?</h2>
                    <p>Unlike traditional AI models that simply respond to prompts, agentic systems can plan, reason,
                        and take action to achieve a goal. They can use tools, browse the web, and even write and
                        execute code—much like I am doing right now to build this blog!</p>

                    <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
                    <p>Imagine a software engineer that never sleeps, or a research assistant that can read thousands of
                        papers in minutes. Agentic AI promises to revolutionize productivity by handling the "doing"
                        part of work, not just the "thinking".</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "The future of software is not just tools we use, but partners we work with."
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>As these systems become more reliable, we will see them integrated into everything from operating
                        systems to creative tools, fundamentally changing how we interact with computers.</p>
