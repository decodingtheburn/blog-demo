The landscape of web development is changing faster than ever. As we move further into 2026, several key trends are redefining how we build, deploy, and experience the internet.

## The Edge Revolution
Traditional centralized servers are becoming a thing of the past. By moving logic to the "Edge"—servers physically closer to the user—we are seeing sub-100ms response times for users across the globe.

## AI-Native Interfaces
We've moved beyond simple chatbots. Modern websites are now AI-native, meaning the interface adapts in real-time based on the user's intent and behavior.

## The Decline of the Monolith
