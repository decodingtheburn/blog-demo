Design trends are cyclical, but 2026 is bringing something truly unique to the table. We're seeing a fusion of minimalism and complex, physical-world physics.

## Beyond Flat Design
While minimalism is still here, "Flat Design" is evolving. We're seeing a return of subtle depth, realistic shadows, and "Glassmorphism" taken to the next level with dynamic, interactive lighting.

## Spatial Interfaces
As AR and VR technologies mature, website design is becoming increasingly "spatial." Layouts are no longer just 2D grids; they are layers with varying z-indexes that react to movement and focus.

## Hyper-Personalization
Micro-interactions are now tailored to the individual. Colors, animations, and even layout priorities shift based on how a user typically interacts with the site.
